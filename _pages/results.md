subtitle: For each of the experiment scenario we show the Yellow robot's estimation of the physical and social goal of the red robot at each time step.
---

Using S-MDP, at different levels of reasoning, Yellow robot estimates the physical and social goal of the red robot at each time step.  The lines <span style="color: blue"> in blue is our Social MDP scores</span>, <span style="color: green">green in green is Inverse planning</span>, <span style="color: purple">purple in purple is the cue-based model</span>, and **in dotted is the ground truth**.
